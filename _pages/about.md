My goal is to develop <b><i>personalized and reliable multimodal AI agents</i></b>. My research focuses on personalizing Multimodal Large Language Models, exploring post-training methods (<i>e.g.,</i> DPO), systems (<i>e.g.,</i> RAG), and ways to leverage structured representations to complement these models to achieve the goal.

If you are interested in collaboration or have opportunities that align with my expertise, please feel free to reach out to me via contact email.
